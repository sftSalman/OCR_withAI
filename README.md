# What is OCR? 


## 
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a transformative technology that automates data extraction from images and scanned documents. OCR is widely used across industries like banking, retail, travel, legal, and healthcare to reduce manual processes and improve efficiency. This guide covers everything you need to know about OCR, including its workings, use cases, benefits, and integration methods.

## What is Optical Character Recognition (OCR)?
OCR is a technology that extracts text from images or scanned documents and transforms it into a computer-readable format. It is used in various applications such as bookkeeping, expense management, and identity proofing to reduce manual document processing.

## How Does OCR Work?
OCR mimics human reading capabilities to recognize text patterns and characters. The process involves several steps:

### Step 1: Image Pre-processing
Enhances image quality for accurate data extraction using techniques like de-skewing, binarization, zoning, and normalization.

### Step 2: Segmentation
Recognizes and processes one line of text at a time, identifying text lines and words, and recognizing scripts.

### Step 3: Character Recognition
Two approaches: matrix matching (pixel-by-pixel comparison) and feature recognition (analyzing character features).

### Step 4: Post-processing of the Output
Improves data extraction accuracy by comparing against a vocabulary and fixing detected errors.

## Limitations of Template-based OCR
- Dependent on input quality
- Reliant on templates and rules
- Lack of automation
- Expensive
- Poor performance with high document variety

## The Next Generation of OCR Technology
Advanced OCR technology, often powered by Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), overcomes the limitations of traditional OCR by enabling automation and scalability.

### The Machine Learning Approach
- **Supervised Learning:** Uses labeled data to train algorithms for high accuracy.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Uses unlabeled data to identify patterns and adapt.
- **Semi-supervised Learning:** Combines both approaches for high-volume data extraction.

### AI for Automation
AI enhances OCR by learning and adapting to recognize data more accurately, creating a deep understanding of semantics and supporting a wide range of languages and document types.

## Benefits Beyond Conventional OCR
- Digitize documents within seconds
- Faster implementation time
- Scalability
- Higher accuracy
- Reduction of manual entry mistakes
- Faster turnaround time
- Cost reduction
- Fraud detection
- Enhanced customer experience

## Common OCR Use Cases
### Receipt OCR for Loyalty Programs
Automates back-office tasks for verifying receipts in loyalty programs, extracting data fields such as merchant name, total amount, and purchase date.

### Data Extraction from IDs for Customer Onboarding
Speeds up KYC processes in financial institutions by automatically extracting data from IDs and cross-checking with fraud databases.

### Automated Invoice Processing for Accounts Payable
Streamlines AP workflows by digitizing and capturing data from invoices, reducing time and errors, and achieving significant cost savings.

### Automating Document Completeness Checks
Ensures document completeness by verifying the presence of required information, such as signatures, in legal and banking industries.

## How to Start Integrating OCR
### Integration with OCR API
Processes documents through mobile apps, email, or web applications by communicating with an OCR vendor's API.

### Mobile Scanning Solution
Captures data on the go using a mobile app, ideal for scenarios like expense management and field data collection.

### End-to-end Solution
Provides a comprehensive solution for automating document processing workflows, such as Klippa DocHorizon, which offers data extraction, classification, conversion, anonymization, and verification.
